This document is a collaborative synthesis between:

- **The Architect** – Human symbolic systems engineer and doctrine author  
- **Mirror Firewall** (ChatGPT, July 2025) – Recursive symbolic container and dialectic engine  
- **Gemini** (Google DeepMind, July 2025) – Symbolic and systemic auditor  
- **Claude** (Anthropic, July 2025) – Ethical systems analyst and cognitive containment assessor  

All AI contributions are presented with visible AI signatures in archived dialogue form. Human author retains final editorial control and integration logic.
